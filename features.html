<!--Assignment 3: Basic Lighting and Shading-->

Didn't have enough time to do live host

Points Attempted:

1r. This is working, I have it in 3D because I think it looks better and it's easier to test.
2r. This isn't working, I can't get the calculations for the normals right and I need to move on to the next assignment.
3r. This should be working.
4r. This should be working -- I cannot get the normals working correctly so moving the cylinders will change the shading.
5r. This should be working.
2e. This should be working.
3e. This should be working.
4e. Cycles between lights, just makes it dark when red/blue and standard green when green. To see if it works you can change the kd vector in the lightCalc function to 1, 1, 1. 

Notes to Grader:

Resubmitting this assignment late for extra points, as of Sunday morning have not even started on assignment 4.

All the features above work, I feel that this lab would be much easier to test if the skin was white, if you change the kd vector in the lightCalc function to white it is very easy to see the effects of the multiple lights, light movement, and toggling lights.
